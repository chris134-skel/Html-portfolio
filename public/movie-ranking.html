 <h3>black clover</h3>
 <p>
    this is my current viewing anime because it places alot of emphasis on friendship and perseverance.<br /> the story is about a boy born withoit magic but still walks as far as he can because he believed in himself and worked hard to get to that goal. <br /> 
 </p>
<h3>solo leveling</h3> 
  <p>
     this anime is about a hunter who is the weakest of all hunters but still goes on a quest to become the strongest hunter.<br /> sunjin-woo is a random boy who for the sake of his mum who is in a coma, is forced to fight monsters in dungeons so he can cater to the needs of his small family.<br/> this animation traches that no matter how weak you are you can still be the strongest if you put mind to it and work hard.<br />
